# Temple Maze

This game is a maze-style version of Temple Run. The main objective is to navigate through the maze, collecting pieces of artifacts to combine them together and accumulate points while avoiding being eaten by the monsters guarding the temple. The player will face multiple obstacles such as limitations on the total weight of artifacts they can carry and the threat of the monsters looking for their next meal. They will also have the ability, though, to collect various powerups and new character types through the collection of gems and the use of a spinner. These powerups can be used to enhance the player's experience and improve their gameplay. Players also have the ability to choose the level (speed) at which they wish to play each round of the game based on their preferences.

## Game Context
You have joined a group of temple robbers in their mission to steal artifacts from ancient temples. Go forth on your solo adventure through the temple maze, in search of these priceless artifacts. As you run, BEWARE the monsters! You're a crunchy human... They will be looking for every chance to eat you when you least expect it.
